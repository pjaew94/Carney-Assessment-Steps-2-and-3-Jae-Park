## Set Up

1\. Ensure that the server for this application is running on port 5000 before starting.
You can find the server with part 1 task completed by me here:
https://github.com/pjaew94/code-test-express

2\. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies

3\. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the application on local development server on port 3000

4\. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application.
