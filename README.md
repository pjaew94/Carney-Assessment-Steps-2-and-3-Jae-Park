## Set Up

1\. Ensure that the server for this application is running on port 5000 before starting.
You can find the server with part 1 task completed by me here:
https://github.com/pjaew94/code-test-express

2\. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies

3\. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the application on local development server on port 3000

4\. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to see the application.

## Run Down

# Tech Stack
*NextJS - React Framework
*ReactJS - Frontend Framework
*TailwindCSS - Styling
*Typescript - Programming Language
*AdobeXD - Mock Up

# Process
1\. Before starting to code, I came up with a rough sketch and design on how the final result should look like using AdobeXD. 
2\. I used ReactJS as it allows more organized code and simple state management.

3\. Styling was done with TailwindCSS as it allows easy mobile to desktop responsive development, whereas styling with style sheets would require multiple media queries and className assignments.
